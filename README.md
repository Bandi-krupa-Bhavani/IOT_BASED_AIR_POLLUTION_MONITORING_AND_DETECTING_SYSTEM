# IOT_BASED_AIR_POLLUTION_MONITORING_AND_DETECTION_SYSTEM
An innovative IoT-based solution for monitoring and detecting harmful gas emissions from bike silencers. This system alerts the rider in real-time when pollution levels exceed safe thresholds and can even trigger automatic shutdown of the bike engine if no corrective action is taken.
## 🛠️ Features
- 📡 Real-time monitoring of gas emissions (CO, CO₂, NOx)
  
- 🚨 Instant alerts using buzzer, LED, or display
  
- ☁️ IoT integration for remote data access (e.g., via Blynk/Thingspeak/AWS IoT Core)
  
- 📈 Live dashboards for visualizing pollution data
  
- ⚙️ Engine shutdown via relay if pollution persists
  
- 📍 Optional GPS tracking of pollution hotspots
## 🔧 Components Used
| Component |              | Description |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| ESP32 |                  | Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller |
| MQ-135 / MQ-7 Sensor |   | Gas sensor for detecting pollutants |
| Relay Module |           | For engine control based on pollution |
| Buzzer / LED |           | Alerts the rider in case of high pollution |
| OLED / LCD Display|      | Display gas level readings |
## 📟 Working Principle
1. Gas sensors continuously measure exhaust emissions.
   
2. ESP32 reads sensor values and sends data to the cloud.
   
3. If gas concentration exceeds the set threshold:
   
   - Buzzer/LED notifies the rider.
     
   - Data is uploaded to an IoT platform for remote monitoring.
     
   - After a timeout, the relay cuts engine power if the issue persists.
